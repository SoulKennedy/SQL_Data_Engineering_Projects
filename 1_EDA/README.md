# Exploratory Data Analysis w/SQL: Job Market Analysis 

![Project 1 Preview](../Images\1_1_Project1_EDA.png)  

A SQL project analyzing the Data Engineer job market using real world job posting data. It demonstrates my ability to **write production-quality analytical SQL, design efficient queries, and turn business questions into data-driven insights.**

## 🧾Executive Summary
- ✅ **Project scope:** Built 3 analytical queries that answer key questions about the Data Engineer job market
- ✅ **Data modeling:** Used multi-table joins across fact and dimension tables to extract insights
- ✅ **Analytics:** Applied aggregations, filtering, and sorting to find top skills by demand, salary, and overall value
- ✅ **Outcomes:** Delivered actionable insights on SQL/Python dominance, cloud trends, and salary patterns

If you only have a minute, review these:

1. [Top Demanded Skills Query](../1_EDA/01_top_demanded_skills.sql) – demand analysis with multi-table joins

2. [Top Paying Skills Query](../1_EDA/02_top_paying_skills.sql) – salary analysis with aggregations

3. [Optimal Skills Query](../1_EDA/03_optimal_skills.sql) – combined demand/salary optimization


## 🧩 Problem & Context
Job market analysts need to answer questions like:

- 🎯 **Most in-demand:** *Which skills are most in-demand for data engineers?*
- 💰 **Highest paid:** *Which skills command the highest salaries?*
- ⚖️ **Best trade-off:** *What is the optimal skill set balancing demand and compensation?*

This project analyzes a data warehouse built using a star schema design. The warehouse structure consists of:

![Data Warehouse](../Images\1_2_Data_Warehouse.png)

- **Fact Table:** `job_postings_fact` - Central table containing job posting details (job titles, locations, salaries, dates, etc.)

- **Dimension Tables:**
- `company_dim` - Company information linked to job postings

- `skills_dim` - Skills catalog with skill names and types

- **Bridge Table:**
- `skills_job_dim` - Resolves the many-to-many relationship between job postings and skills

By querying across these interconnected tables, I extracted insights about skill demand, salary patterns, and optimal skill combinations for data engineering roles.

## 🧰Tech Stack
- 🐤 **Query Engine:** DuckDB for fast OLAP-style analytical queries
- 🧮 **Language:** SQL (ANSI-style with analytical functions)
- 📊 **Data Model:** Star schema with fact + dimension + bridge tables
- 🛠️ **Development:** VS Code for SQL editing + Terminal for DuckDB CLI
- 📦 **Version Control:** Git/GitHub for versioned SQL scripts

## Analysis Overview
**Query Structure**

**[Top Demanded Skills](../1_EDA/01_top_demanded_skills.sql)** – Identifies the 10 most in-demand skills for remote data engineer positions

**[Top Paying Skills](../1_EDA/02_top_paying_skills.sql)** – Analyzes the 25 highest-paying skills with salary and demand metrics

**[Optimal Skills](../1_EDA/03_optimal_skills.sql)** – Calculates an optimal score using natural log of demand combined with median salary to identify the most valuable skills to learn

## Key Insights
- **🧠 Core languages:** SQL and Python each appear in ~29,000 job postings, making them the most demanded skills
- **☁️ Cloud platforms:** AWS and Azure are critical for modern data engineering roles
- **🧱 Infra & tooling:** Kubernetes, Docker, and Terraform are associated with premium salaries
- **🔥 Big data tools:** Apache Spark shows strong demand with competitive compensation

## 💻 SQL Skills Demonstrated
**Query Design & Optimization**

- **Complex Joins:** Multi-table `INNER JOIN` operations across `job_postings_fact`, `skills_job_dim`, and `skills_dim`
- **Aggregations:** `COUNT()`, `MEDIAN()`, `ROUND()` for statistical analysis
- **Filtering:** Boolean logic with WHERE clauses and multiple conditions (`job_title_short`, `job_work_from_home`, `salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL`)
- **Sorting & Limiting:** `ORDER BY` with `DESC` and `LIMIT` for top-N analysis

**Data Analysis Techniques**

- **Grouping:** `GROUP BY` for categorical analysis by skill
Mathematical Functions: `LN()` for natural logarithm transformation to normalize demand metrics
- **Calculated Metrics:** Derived optimal score combining log-transformed demand with median salary
- **HAVING Clause:** Filtering aggregated results (skills with >= 100 postings)
- **NULL Handling:** Proper filtering of incomplete records (`salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL`)
